<div class="mission">

  <p>Rap started as a genre that is heavily territorial; the sounds and aesthetics were often shared contagiously within a region. With the advent of internet-shared rap, the region-specific sounds and aesthetics became a bit more ambiguous and influences spread regardless of locality. Mixtapes, in particular, are a medium that can be seen as a proving ground for both new and established artists. Because they're free, and not necessarily under the heavy advisement of a corporation, mixtapes are often a more raw, experimental expression of the artist.</p>

  <p>As a designer with an interest in the niche of mixtape artwork, I made Banger Gallery to find out if there's a correlation between location and styles of artwork like there is with region-specific sound. I took the top 500 mixtapes on DatPiff, and wrote a program to determine the predominant color palette of the cover and calculate the visual complexity based on those results.</p>

  <p>The goal is to give visitors tools to be able to come to their own conclusions, like how Houston-influenced rappers tend to use more purple on their covers, or how rappers from Atlanta have the most visually complex covers. By collecting this information and displaying it in a new way, hopefully you can find unique relationships within mixtape artwork that you wouldn't have seen otherwise.</p>
